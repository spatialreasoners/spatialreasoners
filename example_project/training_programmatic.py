"""
Simple demo script for Spiral Training using SpatialReasoners API (Programmatic)

This script demonstrates the programmatic way to run spiral training:
1. Import the spiral classes (auto-registers them)
2. Define overrides as a list of strings
3. Call sr.run_training() with the overrides

This approach is useful when you want to configure training within your code.
For CLI-based configuration, see training_decorator.py instead.

Run this script from the project root directory.
