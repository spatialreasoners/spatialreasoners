## Overview

ðŸŒ€Spatial Reasoners is a Python package for spatial reasoning over continuous variables with generative denoising models. Denoising generative models have become the de-facto standard for image generation, due to their effectiveness in sampling from complex, high-dimensional distributions. Recently, they have started being explored in the context of reasoning over multiple continuous variables.

Our package provides a comprehensive framework to facilitate research in this area, offering easy-to-use interfaces to control:

*   **Variable Mapping:** Seamlessly map to variables from arbitrary data domains.
*   **Generative Model Paradigms:** Flexibly work with a wide range of denoising formulations.
*   **Samplers & Inference Strategies:** Implement and experiment with diverse samplers and inference techniques.

ðŸŒ€Spatial Reasoners is a generalization of [Spatial Reasoning Models (SRMs)](https://geometric-rl.mpi-inf.mpg.de/srm/) to new domains, packaged as a reusable library for the research community.

## Key Features

- **ðŸš€ One-line Training**: Get started with minimal setup using sensible defaults
- **ðŸ”§ Flexible Configuration**: Powerful config system with automatic merging of local and embedded configurations
- **ðŸ“¦ Modular Architecture**: Extensible design with pluggable components for datasets, models, and training strategies
- **ðŸ”¬ Research-Ready**: Built-in benchmarks, evaluation protocols, and example projects
- **âš¡ Production-Ready**: Lightning-based training infrastructure with distributed training support

## Architecture Overview

Spatial Reasoners is built with modularity and extensibility in mind:

```

## Research Applications

Spatial Reasoners are a generalization of the idea of diffusion models that allows using different noise levels within a sample. Before SRMs this approach has been explored by for example MAR, xAR, Rolling Diffusion and Diffusion Forcing -- Spatial Reasoners allows you to build similiar setups. For some architectures (such as Unet, DiT, xAR's variant of DiT or History Guided Diffusion's U-ViT-pose) you can just specify the denoiser config and directly start training. 

In some domains starting your work could be even faster due to already implemented Variable Mappers and some evaluations -- this is true for tasks like:

- **Sudoku generation** Our MNIST Sudoku dataset
- **Image generation** With prepared dataset implementations for ImageNet, CIFAR10, CelebA, SRM's Counting Stars and many others
- **Video generation** Where a variable is a single frame -- as in [Diffusion Forcing](https://www.boyuan.space/diffusion-forcing/)

We also highly encourage you to take Spatial Reasoners to completely new domains -- see our [example project](https://github.com/spatialreasoners/spatialreasoners/tree/main/example_project) to see how to train new models in your domain!
