## Overview

ðŸŒ€Spatial Reasoners is a Python package for spatial reasoning over continuous variables with generative denoising models. Denoising generative models have become the de-facto standard for image generation, due to their effectiveness in sampling from complex, high-dimensional distributions. Recently, they have started being explored in the context of reasoning over multiple continuous variables.

Our package provides a comprehensive framework to facilitate research in this area, offering easy-to-use interfaces to control:

*   **Variable Mapping:** Seamlessly map variables from arbitrary data domains.
*   **Generative Model Paradigms:** Flexibly work with a wide range of denoising formulations.
*   **Samplers & Inference Strategies:** Implement and experiment with diverse samplers and inference techniques.

ðŸŒ€Spatial Reasoners is a generalization of [Spatial Reasoning Models (SRMs)](https://geometric-rl.mpi-inf.mpg.de/srm/) to new domains, packaged as a reusable library for the research community.

## Key Features

## Research Applications

Spatial Reasoners has been used for research in:

- **Spatial reasoning tasks** (MNIST Sudoku, polygon counting)
- **Image generation** where there could be some spatial dependencies between regions of the image
- **Video generation** such as in [Diffusion Forcing](https://www.boyuan.space/diffusion-forcing/)
